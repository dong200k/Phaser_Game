 * The ClientSidePrediction class will manage the prediction of player1 to match that of the server's.
 * Its main purpose would be movement prediction. Which would consist of the following:
 *  - Movement from WASD
 *  - Movement blocked by obstacles
 *  - Animations from movement
 * 
 * To accomplish this updates on both the client and server would need to be deterministic.
