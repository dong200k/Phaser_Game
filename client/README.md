# Dungeon and Adventurers Client
This document describes the client implementation for Dungeons and Adventurers.

## Technology
For our game engine of choice we are going to use the Phaser 3 Game Engine. We choose this engine because of its maturity and because it is used to create web games. The documentation for Phaser can be found [here](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/).  

In order to enforce types to our code both the client and server will use Typescript. With Typescript we can make use of object oriented programming, type checking, and reduce errors in our code. The documentation for Typescript can be found [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
